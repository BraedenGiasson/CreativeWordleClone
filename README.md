## :question: Why this Project?

This project came to light when I decided to combine my fun of playing the original **[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)** game, with a slight twist.

From the beginning of playing Wordle, I got **hooked** fast. It's such a simple game, yet so **fun** and **addictive**, and you can easily **lose track of time** playing it. However, there were a few aspects about the original game that felt **boring** and **mundane**.    

This is when the **idea** popped up, to create a **Wordle clone** as a personal project, with a few **[variations](#twisted_rightwards_arrows-wordle-variations)**.  

## :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Wordle Variations

Why not add a few variations to the game to make it just a little bit more **enjoyable**?

### :dizzy: Infinite games

Isn't it **annoying** that you can only play the Wordle game once a day? Isn't it so fun to play you wish you can just **keep playing**? 

That's where one of the variation ideas came to mind, in **my clone**, you can play **game after game**, for **as long as you want**! There is **no limit** to how many times you can play during a day, because every new game you play, is a new **randomly selected word** from a list of **thousands**.

So, **after every game** you play, just click '**Play Again**', or **refresh the page** to play again! 
### :information_source: 5, 6, and 7 letter words

The classic Wordle game functions off guessing a **5 letter word**, but wouldn't it be fun for a **change** to play **different sized words**?

In **my clone**, you have the option to play **5, 6,** and even **7 letter words!** 

This is a fun twist on the original Wordle game, allowing you to **challenge yourself** to **harder** and **tougher** words.

Simply click on the **settings icon**, and **select a different option**. If you are **currently in a game** and want to switch options, you can still do so by clicking on the settings icon, selecting a different option, and **confirm** you want to switch. This page will **refresh** into the a **new game** with the new letter count.

:warning: For whichever **option** you play, you still ***ONLY*** have a **maximum of 6 guesses** to **correctly guess** the    word.
###  :art: Wordle Colors

The classis Wordle game **colors cannot change**, but why not? Why not have some **fun** and **creativity** to **change the colors** to how you would like to play!

In **my clone**, you will be able to change the colors of the **correct**, **incorrect**, and **in-word** colors! You will also be able to **[reset the colors](#resetting-colors)** to the **default** game **colors**.

To **change these colors**, click on the **settings icon**, and you will see a 'Colors' section, with the different guess colors to change. Simply click on the color associated with the guess type, and use the color picker to change colors. Once you have decided on a new color, click save to change the color in the game.

The **default color** for a '**Correct Guess**' in my clone is :green_apple: **green**.

The **default color** for a '**In-Word Guess**' in my clone is :yellow_heart: **yellow**.

The **default color** for a '**Incorrect Guess**' in my clone is :grey_exclamation: **grey**.

#### Resetting colors

The benefit with being able to change the colors, is you can also **reset** them if you don't like the **color** you chose! 

To **reset** the guess type **colors** to their **default colors**, click on the **settings icon**, and click the '**Reset Colors**' button. The game will ask you to **confirm** if you want to **reset** the colors, as the game will obviously not anymore save the colors you chose. 

Click '**yes**' if you want to **reset the colors**, and just like that, the change is **immediate**!

Click '**no**' if you **don't want to reset the colors** at the given time.
