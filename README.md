## :question: Why this Project?

This project came to light when I decided to combine my fun of playing the original **[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)** game, with a slight twist.

From the beginning of playing Wordle, I got **hooked** fast. It's such a simple game, yet so **fun** and **addictive**, and you can easily **lose track of time** playing it. However, there were a few aspects about the original game that felt **boring** and **mundane**.    

This is when the **idea** popped up, to create a **Wordle clone** as a personal project, with a few **[variations](#twisted_rightwards_arrows-wordle-variations)**.  

## :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Wordle Variations

Why not add a few variations to the game to make it just a little bit more **enjoyable**?

### Infinite games

Isn't it **annoying** that you can only play the Wordle game once a day? Isn't it so fun to play you wish you can just **keep playing**? 

That's where one of the variation ideas came to mind, in **my clone**, you can play **game after game**, for **as long as you want**! There is **no limit** to how many times you can play during a day, because every new game you play, is a new **randomly selected word** from a list of **thousands**.

So, **after every game** you play, just click '**Play Again**', or **refresh the page** to play again! 
### 5, 6, and 7 letter words

The classic Wordle game functions off guessing a **5 letter word**, but wouldn't it be fun for a **change** to play **different sized words**?

In **my clone**, you have the option to play **5, 6,** and even **7 letter words!** 

This is a fun twist on the original Wordle game, allowing you to **challenge yourself** to **harder** and **tougher** words.

Simply click on the **settings icon**, and **select a different option**. If you are **currently in a game** and want to switch options, you can still do so by clicking on the settings icon, selecting a different option, and **confirm** you want to switch. This page will **refresh** into the a **new game** with the new letter count.

:warning: For whichever **option** you play, you still ***ONLY*** have a **maximum of 6 guesses** to **correctly guess** the    word.
